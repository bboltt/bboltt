Huge thanks to Henry. I was lucky to work on your team for a year, and in that time I learnt a lot from you. You’re the rare manager who is truly hands-on. You never afraid to dive into code, or debug a pipeline, or kick off jobs. You work extremely hard. it’s never just about hours. It’s about your ambition. I really respect that you always trying to build things systematic and standardized. So the work scales beyond just one person. I learned a lot from you, and I’m grateful for your trust and the bar you set. And I wish  you every success in what’s next.
