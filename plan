### Bucketing of the Amount Feature

To enhance the fraud detection capability of the Gradient Boosted Tree (GBTClassifier) model—particularly addressing its tendency to misclassify high-value checks as non-fraudulent—we applied a targeted bucketing strategy on the transaction amount feature.

The bucketing approach transformed the continuous `amount` feature into discrete intervals. Specifically, we implemented **multi-granularity bins** to handle the varying distribution of fraud across different check amounts:

- For transaction amounts between \$0 and \$1,000, we created relatively fine-grained bins, each spanning \$50 increments (e.g., \$0–50, \$50–100, \$100–150, …, \$950–1,000). These narrower bins enable the model to effectively differentiate fraud patterns within the lower-value range, where fraud occurrences are more frequent.

- For amounts between \$1,000 and \$2,000, the granularity was broadened to \$100 increments (e.g., \$1,000–1,100, \$1,100–1,200, …, \$1,900–2,000). This broader interval balances the sensitivity to fraud occurrences with the need to avoid overly-specific numeric splits for intermediate amounts.

- Finally, all transaction amounts above \$2,000 were grouped into a single broad bucket (> \$2,000). This intentional aggregation prevents the model from relying on simplistic numeric thresholds at high transaction values, compelling it to use other, potentially more informative features to detect fraud among large checks, where fraudulent examples are typically sparse.

This structured, multi-level bucketing methodology preserves existing strong fraud-detection performance at lower amounts, while effectively addressing the model’s previous shortcoming in recognizing high-value fraudulent checks.
