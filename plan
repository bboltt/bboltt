Below is an updated **documentation‐style** explanation for the chart. Rather than just describing the plot, it emphasizes *why* the chosen train/test splits are appropriate and how the weekly trends help confirm their similarity. You can insert or adapt this text directly into your documentation.

### Explanation of the Weekly Aggregated Charts

The three charts below (Weekly Transaction Count, Weekly Fraud Count, and Weekly Fraud Rate) compare the **training set** (blue line) and the **testing set** (orange line) across weekly intervals from April 22, 2024, through November 8, 2024. They serve two main purposes:

1. **Visual Data Quality Check**: By plotting the total transactions, fraud count, and resulting fraud rate week‐by‐week, we can identify any anomalies or missing data segments in either the training or testing partition. This helps confirm that both subsets capture consistent patterns over time.

2. **Assessing Representativeness**: The charts show that the overall weekly patterns in transaction volume, fraud volume, and fraud rate are broadly similar between the training and test sets. In other words, neither set skews toward an unusual period of very high or very low fraud.  
   - **Weekly Transaction Count**: The training and test lines track each other’s up‐and‐down trends, indicating that both sets experience similar volumes on a weekly basis.  
   - **Weekly Fraud Count**: The relative level of fraud stays within a comparable range in both sets, suggesting that neither partition systematically omits or concentrates fraud events.  
   - **Weekly Fraud Rate**: The percentage of fraudulent transactions (fraud count divided by total transactions) follows a broadly similar trend in both sets.  
   
Together, these observations give confidence that the **test set** is a **reasonable hold‐out** sample. It comes from the same timeframe, experiences similar levels of transaction volume, and exposes the model to a consistent pattern of fraud behavior. That way, performance estimates on the test set should reliably reflect how the model would handle fraud in real‐world conditions.
